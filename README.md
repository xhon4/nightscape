# Nightscape 🌌

Who doesn’t love a starry sky? ✨

## What does it do? 🤔

- **Moon**: A chill moon hangs out at the top of your terminal.
- **Stars**: 74 stars twinkle smoothly. Yep, exactly 74. No more, no less.
- **Random Events**:
  - Stars can turn off or on (because why not?).
  - Comets streak across the sky like they're late for a meeting.
  - UFOs show up occasionally. Are they friendly? Who knows.
